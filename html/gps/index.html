<!--
1) What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
- purpose is to provide meaning to HTML, and make it more readable and accessible to people
- useful: header, footer, nav (I'm not sure how to use the other semantic tags well yet to know its usefulness)

2) What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
- sections, headings, implicit sectioning, sectioning root, sections outside the outline, headers and footers

3) What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
- learned to create new snippets (keyboard shortcuts)
- will create snippets for basic forms and tables in the future

4) What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
- the HTML5 sections' semantic elements still confuses me, not sure how to use it properly (what can nest under what)
- researching more and reviewing code examples will help
