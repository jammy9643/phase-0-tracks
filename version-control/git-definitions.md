# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - a system for tracking changes to a file(s) over time & can also reverse changes
    - allows us to view the entire history of revisions to a file(s) & merge revisions made by different people (Version Control and Git, 1:37)
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - used to diverge from the master file for editing without overwriting the master file & can be merged with the master file afterwards
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - a save point in Git
    - a good commit message is specific
* What is a merge conflict?
    - conflict in merging 2 branch files together
    - most commonly happens when the same lines of the same file are changed by 2 different people
